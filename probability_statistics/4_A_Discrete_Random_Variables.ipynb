    "\n",
    "A random variable assigns a number to each outcome in a sample space. It is 'random' because its value depends on a random outcome of an experiment. And we treat random variable like we  would a usual variable: we can add it to other random variables, square it, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability and statistics, random variables are used to qunatify outcomes of a random occurence, and therefore, can take on many values. Random variables are required to be measurable and are typically real numbers. For example, the letter X may be designated to represent the sum of the resulting numbers after three dice are rolled. In this case, X  could be 3(1+1+1), 18(6+6+6), or somewhere between 3 and 18, since the highest number of a die is 6 and the lowest numbers is 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable is different from an algebra variable. The variable in an algebric equation is an unknown value that can be calculated. The equation 10 + x = 13 shows that we can calculate the specific value for x which is 3. On the other hand, a random variable has a set of values, and any of those values could be the resulting outcomes as seen in the example of the dice above.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variables can be either discrete or continuous. \n",
    "1. Discrete random variables take on a countable number of distinct values. Consider an experiment where a coin is tosssed three times. If X represents the number of times that the coin comes up heads, then X is a discrete random variables that can only have the values 0,1,2,3 (from no heads in three successive coin tosses, to all heads). No other values is possible for X.\n",
    "2. Continuous random variables can represent any value within a specified range or interval, and can take on an infinite number of possible values. An example of a continuous random variable would be an experiment that involves measuring the amount of rainfall in a city over a year, or the average height of a random group of 25 people. Drawing on the latter, if Y represents the random variable for the average height of a random group of 25 people, you will find that the resulting outcome is a continuous figure since height may be 5 ft or 5.01 ft or 5.0001 ft. Clearly, there is an infinite number of possible values for height.\n",

This is because each of the two heads has probability p and each of the 3 tails has probability 1-p. Because the individual tosses are independent we can multiply probabilities. Therefore, the total probability of exactly 2 heads is the sum of 10 identical probabilities, i.e. $ p(2) = 10p^2(1-p)^3. $\n",
