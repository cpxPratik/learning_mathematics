    "A random variable X is continuous if there is a function f(x) such that form any c<=d we have\n",

    "The function f(x) is called the probability density function (pdf).\n",

    "The pdf always satisfied the following properties:\n",
    "1. f(x) >= 0 (f is non negative)\n",
    "2. $ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)dx = 1 $\n",

    "The probability density function f(x) of a continuous random variable is the analogue of the probability mass function p(x) of a discrete random variable. Here are two important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unlike p(x), the pdf f(x) is not a probability. You have to integrate it to get probability.\n",
    "2. Since f(x) is not a probability, there is no restriction that f(x) be less than or equal to 1."
