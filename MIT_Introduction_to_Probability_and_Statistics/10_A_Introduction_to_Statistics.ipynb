    "# What is a statistic? \n",
    "\n",
    "A statistic is anything that can be computed from the collected data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general types of statistics:\n",
    "1. Point statistics: A single value computed from data, such as the sample average or sample standard deviation.\n",
    "2. Interval statistics: An interval [a,b] computed from the data. This is really just a pair of point statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics deals with data. Generally speaking, there are two goals of statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Descritive statistics: It is solely concerned with properties of the observed data like mean, median and interquartile range.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential statistics: It is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution. Often this takes the form of specifying a statistical model for the random process by which the data arised. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very much essential to know what distribution the data follows correctly."
